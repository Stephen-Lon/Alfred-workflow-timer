# Alfred-workflow-timer
An Alfred workflow to run a minute timer in your Mac menu bar

# Introduction

This simple workflow runs a timer in your Mac menu bar for the number of minutes you specify. Note that it links to a macOS `Start Timer` Shortcutâ€”which you need to write.

# The macOS Shortcut

The contents of the Shortcut you need to write are shown in the workflow user configuration.

When you select your `Start Timer` Shortcut in the Alfred `Run Shortcut` Action make sure you choose, at the bottom of the dialog, `Treat input as String` and `Continue immediately and pass through input`.

# Usage

To run the timer type the keyword followed by <space> and the number of minutes you want the timer to run.
